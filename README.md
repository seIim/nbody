Hi!

This is not anywhere near a completed project, but this is my work so far.

The goal of this project is to (1) develop an understanding of numerical methods and several algorithms used in astrophysical simulations, starting with an n-body simulation (2) learn rust! I have no experience in rust but it seems like a very interesting language that I want to be able to use effectively and s(3) learn to use git/github.
